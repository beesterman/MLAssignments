in order to run this code you need to have numpy and pandas installed.

After that you can run the BOW and Bernouliis tests using the functions in the NBtraining.py liste below
you use the constants for BOWtest/trainpaths or the enronrBErTest/TrainPaths and then the enron number to run it

classifyGivenDataBOW(constants.enronBOWTestPaths[2], 3)
classifyGivenDataBernoulli(constants.enronBerTestPaths[2], 3)

if you want to run the LR then you can go the LRTraiinig.py where you can run the ProcessDataFromCSV function to train and test from either a single
dataset or from a train and test set

follow the correct inputs on the function to use it on the specific datasets you would like.
